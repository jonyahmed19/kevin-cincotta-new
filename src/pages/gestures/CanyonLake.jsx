    <p>At the local waterhole, there&apos;s almost a guarantee that a bunch of people will be trying new tricks off of some cliff. I wanted to capture the feeling of being surrounded by mountains and cliffsides as they fold into themselves â€” even if you can&apos;t see the whole landscape at once, there&apos;s a feeling of being completely immersed within its magical geography. I don&apos;t know about causation, but this phenomenon does seem to correlate with the amount of backflips. </p>
